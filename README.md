The research is focused on underwater object detection to classify images as positive or negative. 
The dataset was tested using three different deep learning algorithms and various optimizers.
The chosen algorithms are CNN, DenseNet-264, and VGG-19.
Overall, CNN performed the best in successfully classifying all images compared to the other two algorithms.
VGG-19 showed similar performance to CNN but required significantly more time for training and validation. 
DenseNet-264 exhibited relatively poor performance compared to the other algorithms. 
Therefore, CNN is preferred for image classification tasks.
